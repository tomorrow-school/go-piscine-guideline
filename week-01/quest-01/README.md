# Quest 1

To successfully pass the Go piscine track at 01 edu and complete the QUEST 01 project, you’ll need both basic and advanced skills with Bash, git, working with JSON, understanding Unix utilities (ls, find, cut, sed, awk), and an ability to read manuals and reference documentation. Here’s a structured guideline with links to key resources.

***

### Core Tools You Need

- **Bash and shell scripting basics**: Writing scripts, variables, conditions, loops, file permissions, running commands.
- **Git**: Creating repositories, commit, push, pull, working with remote repositories, code storage and upload.
- **Working with JSON**: The jq utility—parsing, filtering, extracting data from files and via curl.
- **Unix basics**: Commands like ls, find, awk, sed, cut, grep, wc, and their manuals.
- **curl**: Downloading data from Web APIs (for example, fetching superhero data).

- Video walkthroughs are a fast way to understand tasks.
- Keep your own command cheat sheet with short explanations and examples.
